# Crystal Field Theory
## CFT - Assumptions
- purely electrostatic interactions between the metal centre and ligands
- ligands are considered as point charges
- electrons present in the metal centre experience repulsion due to the ligands, and so tend to occupy d-orbitals facing least repulsion

### Energy gap $\Delta$
1. **Octahedral complexes** :
    - For octahedral complexes, the energy gap between $e_g$ and $t_{2g}$ set of orbitals is known as $\Delta_o$.
2. **Tetrahedral complexes** :
    - The energy gap between $t_{2}$ and $e$ set of orbitals is known as $\Delta_t$.

Currently, the most convenient way to measure $\Delta$ is to measure of frequency of the respective peak in Molar absorbance plot. ![[Pasted image 20220114093427.png]]

### Factors affecting $\Delta$
1. **Charge of metal centre**
    - If +ve charge of metal centre increases, it shrinks in size, thus the ligands can approach it closer, thus causing more splitting due to more repulsion from ligands, and thus $\Delta_o$ increases.
2. **Nature of ligands**
    - If EN of donor atom on the ligand increases, then electron density on it increases, and so ligand donation is more effective, thereby causing $\Delta_o$ to increase. ![[Pasted image 20220114095300.png|600]] 
    - Thus we can classify ligands as **Weak Field Ligands** ($\Delta_o$ is between 7000-30000) and **Strong Field Ligands** ($\Delta_o$ is more than 30000).
3. **Nature of orbital**
    - Due to increasing radius of d-orbitals down the period, valence electron density for decreases, and so ligands face lesser repulsion and hence are able to approach the metal centre more closely, thus causing $\Delta_o$ to increase.
4. **Chelation effect**
    - In chelation, one molecule donates to the metal centre from several atoms.
    - When a chelating ligand replaces several monodentate ligands, the result is an increase in the number of free molecules in the system, meaning a relatively **large increase in entropy**. This is the major energetic factor driving the chelate effect.

### $\Delta$ vs Pairing energy (P)
Pairing energy P is inherent to any metal atom, and so is constant for any complex of that metal atom.
1. **Octahedral complexes** :
    For d4-d7 configurations, 
    1. if splitting is large enough such that $\Delta_o>P$, then electrons after d3 pair up in the $t_{2g}$ set of orbitals rather than occupying the $e_g$ set (**low-spin**).
    2. if splitting is insufficient ($\Delta_o<P$), then electrons after d3 occupy $e_g$ set of orbitals (**high-spin**).
2. **Tetrahedral complexes** :
    For d3-d6 configurations, 
    1. if splitting is large enough such that $\Delta>P$, then electrons after d2 pair up in the $e$ set of orbitals rather than occupying the $t_2$ set (**low-spin**).
    2. if splitting is insufficient ($\Delta<P$), then electrons after d2 occupy $t_2$ set of orbitals (**high-spin**).

### Relating $\Delta_o$ and $\Delta_t$
$$
\Delta_t = (2/3)(2/3)\Delta_o = (4/9)\Delta_o
$$

Due to this, tetrahedral complexes generally have **high-spin**.
