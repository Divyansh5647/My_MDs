# Ligand Field Theory
## LCAO
This modelling of a molecular orbital in terms of contributing atomic orbitals is called the **linear combination of atomic orbitals** (LCAO) approximation, i.e. only the **valence shell atomic orbitals** are used to form molecular orbitals.

For two atomic orbitals $\chi_1$ and $\chi_2$, 
1. $\Psi_+ = \chi_1 + \chi_2$ denotes constructive overlap (**bonding molecular orbital**)
2. $\Psi_- = \chi_1 - \chi_2$ denotes destructive overlap (**anti-bonding molecular orbital**)

In general, the wavefunction $\Psi$ is
$$
\Psi = c_1 \chi_1 + c_2 \chi_2
$$

**$\eta$ - Nonbonding molecular orbital **
It is a molecular orbital that has the same energy as the initial atomic orbitals. In this case, occupation of this orbital neither stabilizes nor destabilizes the molecule and so it is described as a nonbonding orbital.

**$\sigma$ - orbital**
$\sigma$ - orbitals are formed by allowing overlap between atomic orbitals that have cylindrical symmetry around the internuclear axis, which is conventionally labelled z.
